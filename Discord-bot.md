## Discord API and the discord.py library. Here's an example of how to do it:

First, you'll need to create a bot on Discord and invite it to your server.
You can follow the official Discord documentation for creating a bot.
Install the discord.py library using pip install discord.py.
Once you have created the bot and installed the library,
you can use the following Python code to send a notification to your Discord group:

```python
import discord

# Your bot's token
TOKEN = 'your_bot_token_here'

# The ID of the channel you want to send the message to
CHANNEL_ID = 'your_channel_id_here'

# Initialize the Discord client
client = discord.Client()

# Define your message content
message_content = "Hello, this is a beautiful notification!"

# Define the message embed
embed = discord.Embed(title="Notification Title", description="Notification Description", color=0xff0000)

# Add a field to the embed
embed.add_field(name="Field Name", value="Field Value", inline=False)

# Send the message and embed to the specified channel
@client.event
async def on_ready():
    channel = client.get_channel(CHANNEL_ID)
    await channel.send(content=message_content, embed=embed)

# Run the client
client.run(TOKEN)
```
